SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Explains Pstep.
    
LONG DESCRIPTION

    Pstep (pronounced /step/, the "p" is silent, like "pterodactyl") is a 
    database migration/change management/versioning tool.  It allows you to write 
    migration scripts which describe changes you want to make to a database.  
    These scripts then get added to your version control system along with code 
    that uses the new database changes.     

    When you pull down the latest code (or deploy it to an environment), you can 
    also apply the corresponding schema changes so that everything stays in sync.
    
    Every Pstep migration is really a PowerShell script with a special name and 
    that contains two migration functions.  The migration filename should have 
    the format `<timestamp>_<description>.ps1`.  Timestamp is a unique number 
    which increases every time a new migration is created.  By default, Pstep 
    uses a timestamp with second precision.  `Description` is a short description
    of what the migration is doing.

    There should be two functions inside a migration, `Push-Migration` and 
    `Pop-Migration`.  The `Push-Migration` function should make changes to the 
    database.  The `Pop-Migration` function should reverse those changes, so you 
    can put the database back in the state it was in before it was migrated.

    Once released, migrations are immutable and should not be changed.  Pstep 
    keeps track of which migrations have been applied against a database.  If you 
    change a migration once it has been applied to a database, it won't get 
    re-applied because Pstep has already recorded that it was applied.  Create a 
    new migration to make the new change.

    All changes made in either `Push-Migration` or `Pop-Migration` are wrapped in 
    a transaction.  If any change fails to get made/applied, all changes are 
    rolled back.
