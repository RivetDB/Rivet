SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Explains the Rivet plug-in system

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Rivet plug-ins allow users to modify migration operations or perform other work 
    before and after an operation is applied to a database.  Examples include:

     * Validating that all tables/columns have descriptions.
     * Automatically adding created and last updated columns to each new table.
     * Validating that any raw SQL doesn't include a `USE` statement.
     * Preventing certain operations from being used, e.g. `Rename-Column`.
     * Customizing constraint and index names.
     
    There are two plug-in points: before an operation is applied to a database and 
    after an operation is applied to a database.

    In order to cancel a migration, a plug-in *must throw an exception*. For example,

        throw ('Operation is invalid: all tables are required to specify a description. Use the -Description parameter to document this table''s purpose.')
        
    To enable plug-ins, you need to configure Rivet so it knows where to look for 
    them. Set the `plug-insRoot` option to the directory path where you want to put 
    your plug-ins. For example,

        {
            "SqlServerName":  "example.com\Rivet",
            "DatabasesRoot":  "Databases",
            "PluginsRoot":  "Tools\\Rivet\\Plugins"
        }

    Paths in rivet.json files are relative to the rivet.json file. See 
    `about_Rivet_Configuration` for more information.

    Once you've defined your plug-ins directory, you create the plug-in scripts. To 
    run code *before* an operation is applied to database, create a 
    `Start-MigrationOperation.ps1` script in your plug-ins directory. It should look 
    like this:

        function Start-MigrationOperation
        {
            [CmdletBinding()]
            param(
                [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
                [Rivet.Migration]
                # The migration the operation is part of.
                $Migration,
                
                [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
                [Rivet.Operation]
                # The operation which is about to be applied.
                $Operation
            )
            
            Set-StrictMode -Version 'Latest'
            
            # Your plug-in logic goes here.
        }
        
    To run code *after* an operation is applied to a database, create a 
    `Complete-MigrationOperation.ps1` script in your plug-ins directory. It should 
    look like this:

        function Complete-MigrationOperation
        {
            [CmdletBinding()]
            param(
                [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
                [Rivet.Migration]
                # The migration the operation is part of.
                $Migration,
                
                [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
                [Rivet.Operation]
                # The operation which was just applied.
                $Operation
            )
            
            Set-StrictMode -Version 'Latest'
        
            # Your plug-in logic goes here.
        }
        
    Rivet ships with some sample plug-ins. Look in the `RivetSamples` directory.

    Each plug-in should have two parameters: the first is a `Rivet.Migration` 
    object representing the migration getting run. The second is a 
    `Rivet.Operation` object representing the specific operation getting run. Each 
    plug-in will get called for each operation in a migration. You'll get the same 
    migration object for each operation in that migration.
    
    Each operation in Rivet is represented by a unique C# object that you 
    can modify. You can't remove operations from being run. Instead, throw an 
    exception to reject the operation. You are allowed to run additional operations 
    and/or return additional C# operation objects. See the sample plug-ins in the 
    `RivetSamples` directory that ships with Rivet.
