SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Rivet is a database migration/change management/versioning tool inspired by 
    Ruby on Rails' Migrations. It creates and applies migration scripts for SQL 
    Server databases. Migration scripts describe changes to make to your 
    database, e.g. add a table, add a column, remove an index, etc. Migrations 
    scripts should get added to your version control system so they can be 
    packaged and deployed with your application's code.    
    
    Every Rivet migration is really a PowerShell script with a special name and  
    that contains two migration functions.  The migration filename should have 
    the format `<timestamp>_<description>.ps1`.  Timestamp is a unique number 
    which increases every time a new migration is created.  By default, Rivet 
    uses a timestamp with second precision.  `Description` is a short description 
    of what the migration is doing.     

    There should be two functions inside a migration, `Push-Migration` and 
    `Pop-Migration`.  The `Push-Migration` function should make changes to the 
    database.  The `Pop-Migration` function should reverse those changes, so you 
    can put the database back in the state it was in before it was migrated. 
        
    Once released, migrations are immutable and should not be changed.  Rivet 
    keeps track of which migrations have been applied against a database.  If you 
    change a migration once it has been applied to a database, it won't get 
    re-applied because Rivet has already recorded that it was applied.  Create a 
    new migration to make the new change.
         
    All changes made in either `Push-Migration` or `Pop-Migration` are wrapped in 
    a transaction.  If any change fails to get made/applied, all changes are 
    rolled back.
